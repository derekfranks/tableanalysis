Table Analysis
=============

This function (eventually packaage?) is essentially a wrapper for several existing functions within R.  

The idea is to input a table (or varibles) and output a contingency table, a proportional table, and then conduct pairwise proportional analysis (with corrected p-values) for each category of the independent variable.
